## Current Challenge: DeFi with DevPost
Starting today, you have 5 weeks to come up with a Scrypto blueprint with DeFi functionality. All previous Scrypto challenges had a very specific subject. We saw challenges around decentralized exchanges, lending and DAOs for example. This time around, the subject is broader. We are simply asking you to build a Scrypto blueprint borrowing features from the traditional financial system or a blueprint implementing novel ideas that are not even possible in tradfi. Also, you can team up with others or work independently. Whatever your preference is, we encourage you to participate.
